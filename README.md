# Weather-App
The app works on the data provided by the 'Weather by API Ninjas' API from Rapid API.
To start receiving the data you have to get an API key which you can get for free or by paying from the link below:
https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/weather-by-api-ninjas/
Once get the hold of the key, initialize the const apiKey variable at the line 7 of index.js file and you are good to go.
Happy Searching:)
